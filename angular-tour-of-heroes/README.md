### Angular Tour Heroes Resume
1. The Hero Editor
- Without stand alone-components
- Two ways to bindind [(ngModel)] -> must be import `FormModule` to use it
- ngModel is better to reduce the initial configuration about about the depedencies

2. Display a selection list
- event binding -> (onCheck) (onClick)
- class binding -> bind css class with conditional angular directives

3. Create a feature component
- @Input() one way data binding -> parent to child
